Power BI HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
I have created 6 KPI's 1 slicer and 6 different charts to get a meaning insights of the given Data.

## KPI's
i)Count of Employee.
ii)Attrition.
iii)Attrition Rate.
iv)Average Salary.
v)Average Years.
vi)Average age of Employee.
## Slicer
By using the slicers we can get Data according to different Job Roles.

## Charts
Beside that there are 3 Bar Charts. One of them indicates Attrition By Age Group. One indicates Attrition by Salary. And the last one indicates Attrition by Job Roles.

There is a Donut Chart that indicates Attrition By Education Level of Employees.

The Matrix shows us the exact number of Attritions by different Job Roles.

Lastly the Area Chart indicates the Attrition of Employees by Years at the Company.
